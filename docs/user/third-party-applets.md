title: Third-Party Budgie Applets
description: Additional applets not built into Budgie itself
---


Budgie is a highly customizable desktop environment. As a result, there are many independently developed extensions.

The following is a list of some of the more notable applets and extensions. Please note that the packages on this list were not developed or reviewed by Budgie developers.
Using these packages may break built-in functionality or cause system instability. Please do appropriate research before installing any package on your system.

Is a Budgie extension you developed not on this list? Please submit a pull request to our docs repository on Github. (Only packages included in a major distribution's official repositories will be considered for inclusion.)
